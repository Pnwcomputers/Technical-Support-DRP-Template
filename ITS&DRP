## 3. IMMEDIATE DISASTER RESPONSE PROCEDURES

### FOR DISASTER-LEVEL EMERGENCIES ONLY:
**STOP - Do not attempt troubleshooting. Follow these steps immediately:**

1. **SECURE THE SCENE**
   - If physical danger: Evacuate and call 911
   - If cybersecurity incident: Disconnect affected systems from network IMMEDIATELY
   - If data breach suspected: Stop all data access and preserve evidence

2. **IMMEDIATE NOTIFICATION** (within 5 minutes)
   - Call Office Manager: `[MANAGER_PHONE]`
   - If unavailable, call IT Support: `[IT_PHONE]`
   - Document time of incident and initial observations

3. **CONTAIN THE INCIDENT**
   - Do NOT restart systems showing security alerts
   - Do NOT delete anything, even if it looks suspicious
   - Take photos of error messages or unusual activity
   - Write down exactly what was happening when the incident occurred

## 4. MANDATORY FIRST-LEVEL TROUBLESHOOTING
**For non-disaster issues, complete ALL applicable steps before escalating:**

### STEP 1: BASIC POWER AND CONNECTION CHECKS
- [ ] Verify all power cables are securely connected
- [ ] Check that power strips/surge protectors are ON and functioning
- [ ] Ensure network cables are firmly connected (look for blinking lights)
- [ ] Confirm wireless devices show connection to network

### STEP 2: RESTART PROCEDURES (Must be attempted FIRST)
- [ ] **Computer Issues**: Completely shut down and restart the affected computer(s)
- [ ] **Network Issues**: Unplug router/modem for 30 seconds, then plug back in
- [ ] **Printer Issues**: Power cycle the printer (off for 10 seconds, then on)
- [ ] **POS System**: Follow store-specific POS restart procedure

### STEP 3: BASIC VERIFICATION
- [ ] Test the issue on a different computer/device if available
- [ ] Check if other similar equipment is working normally
- [ ] Verify the issue affects multiple users or just one person
- [ ] Confirm the problem is reproducible (happens consistently)

### STEP 4: CHECK COMMON SOLUTIONS
- [ ] Ensure software is fully closed and reopened
- [ ] Check for obvious error messages and note exact wording
- [ ] Verify correct login credentials are being used
- [ ] Confirm date/time settings are correct on affected devices

### STEP 5: DATA LOSS ASSESSMENT
**If data appears missing or corrupted:**
- [ ] Check Recycle Bin/Trash first
- [ ] Verify you're looking in the correct file location
- [ ] Ask other users if they moved or renamed files
- [ ] Note the last time the data was known to be accessible
- [ ] **DO NOT** attempt to restore backups without IT approval
