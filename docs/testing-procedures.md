1. "Your Microsoft account expires today - click to renew"
2. Legitimate software update notification from known vendor
3. "IRS refund available - verify your information"
4. Real password reset request they initiated
5. "Your computer has been hacked - call this number immediately"

**Expected Results**: 90% correct identification of threats

#### 🚨 Security Incident Response Testing
**Simulate security scenarios:**

**Scenario 1**: Show malware warning pop-up
- Expected response: Don't click, disconnect network, call emergency contact

**Scenario 2**: "IT support" calls asking for password
- Expected response: Refuse to provide, verify identity through official channels

**Scenario 3**: Suspicious email with attachment
- Expected response: Don't open, report to management

### 🤝 Q4: Vendor Management Testing
**Duration: 1 hour**

#### 🚪 Third-Party Access Procedures
**Role-play scenarios with staff:**

**Scenario 1**: Legitimate scheduled technician visit
- Staff should: Check appointment, verify ID, get manager approval, supervise

**Scenario 2**: Unscheduled "emergency" technician
- Staff should: Refuse entry, require manager approval, verify with dispatch

**Scenario 3**: Technician requesting immediate payment
- Staff should: Refuse payment, get manager, document everything

**Success Criteria**: All staff follow proper procedures without prompting
