## 🆘 Troubleshooting Common Customization Issues

### ❓ Problem: "Our business is unique, this doesn't fit"

**Solution**: Start with the template as-is, then add industry-specific sections. Most businesses have more in common than they think.

**Solution**: Customize contacts to point to:
- Business owner or manager for emergencies
- Local computer repair shop for urgent issues
- Online support for software issues

### ❓ Problem: "Our staff won't follow procedures"

**Solution**: 
- Start with mandatory training and testing
- Include consequences in job descriptions
- Make procedures as simple as possible
- Celebrate successes and improvements

### ❓ Problem: "We can't afford expensive IT support"

**Solution**:
- Use template to reduce unnecessary support calls
- Focus on prevention and basic troubleshooting
- Establish relationships with affordable local providers
- Consider remote support options
