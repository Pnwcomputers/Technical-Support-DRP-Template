### EMERGENCY ISSUES (Immediate Response Required)
- Complete system outage affecting all operations
- Payment processing completely down during business hours

- Network security alerts or unusual activity
- Equipment showing signs of imminent failure (smoke, unusual sounds, overheating)

### URGENT ISSUES (Response within 2-4 hours)
- Single critical system down (POS, internet, phone system)
- Partial payment processing failure
- Workstation crashes affecting multiple users
- Backup system failures or alerts
- Internet connectivity issues during business hours

### ROUTINE ISSUES (Response within 24-48 hours)
- Single workstation problems

## 3. IMMEDIATE DISASTER RESPONSE PROCEDURES

### FOR DISASTER-LEVEL EMERGENCIES ONLY:
**STOP - Do not attempt troubleshooting. Follow these steps immediately:**

1. **SECURE THE SCENE**
   - If physical danger: Evacuate and call 911
   - If cybersecurity incident: Disconnect affected systems from network IMMEDIATELY
   - If data breach suspected: Stop all data access and preserve evidence

2. **IMMEDIATE NOTIFICATION** (within 5 minutes)
   - Call `[OFFICE_MANAGER_NAME]`: `[MANAGER_PHONE]`
   - If unavailable, call IT Support: `[IT_PHONE]`
   - Document time of incident and initial observations

3. **CONTAIN THE INCIDENT**
   - Do NOT restart systems showing security alerts
   - Do NOT delete anything, even if it looks suspicious
   - Take photos of error messages or unusual activity
   - Write down exactly what was happening when the incident occurred

## 4. MANDATORY FIRST-LEVEL TROUBLESHOOTING
**For non-disaster issues, complete ALL applicable steps before escalating:**

### STEP 1: BASIC POWER AND CONNECTION CHECKS
- [ ] Verify all power cables are securely connected
- [ ] Check that power strips/surge protectors are ON and functioning
- [ ] Ensure network cables are firmly connected (look for blinking lights)
- [ ] Confirm wireless devices show connection to network

### STEP 2: RESTART PROCEDURES (Must be attempted FIRST)
- [ ] **Computer Issues**: Completely shut down and restart the affected computer(s)
- [ ] **Network Issues**: Unplug router/modem for 30 seconds, then plug back in
- [ ] **Printer Issues**: Power cycle the printer (off for 10 seconds, then on)
- [ ] **POS System**: Follow `[COMPANY_SPECIFIC_POS_RESTART_PROCEDURE]`

### STEP 3: BASIC VERIFICATION
- [ ] Test the issue on a different computer/device if available
- [ ] Check if other similar equipment is working normally
- [ ] Verify the issue affects multiple users or just one person
- [ ] Confirm the problem is reproducible (happens consistently)

### STEP 4: CHECK COMMON SOLUTIONS
- [ ] Ensure software is fully closed and reopened
- [ ] Check for obvious error messages and note exact wording
- [ ] Verify correct login credentials are being used
- [ ] Confirm date/time settings are correct on affected devices

### STEP 5: DATA LOSS ASSESSMENT
**If data appears missing or corrupted:**
- [ ] Check Recycle Bin/Trash first
- [ ] Verify you're looking in the correct file location
- [ ] Ask other users if they moved or renamed files
- [ ] Note the last time the data was known to be accessible
- [ ] **DO NOT** attempt to restore backups without IT approval

## 5. REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION FOR ALL ISSUES

### Use the [Incident Report Template](templates/incident-report-template.md) for all escalations

## 6. DATA BACKUP & RECOVERY AWARENESS

### WHAT STAFF SHOULD KNOW:
**Our Backup System**:
- `[BACKUP_FREQUENCY]` backups of all workstations and server
- Local backups stored on `[LOCAL_BACKUP_LOCATION]`
- Cloud backups provide offsite protection with `[CLOUD_PROVIDER]`
- Backups retained: Workstations (`[WORKSTATION_RETENTION]`), Server (`[SERVER_RETENTION]`), Cloud (`[CLOUD_RETENTION]`)

### CRITICAL DATA LOCATIONS:
- `[CRITICAL_SYSTEM_1]`
- `[CRITICAL_SYSTEM_2]`
- `[CRITICAL_SYSTEM_3]`
- `[BACKUP_STORAGE_LOCATION]`

### WHAT TO DO IF DATA IS MISSING:
1. **DO NOT PANIC** - Most data can be recovered
2. **STOP WORKING** on the affected computer
3. **DO NOT** try to restore anything yourself
4. **DOCUMENT** what data is missing and when it was last seen
5. **REPORT IMMEDIATELY** using emergency procedures

### WHAT NOT TO DO:
- Do not attempt to restore backups without IT authorization
- Do not continue working on a system with suspected data loss
- Do not install recovery software or tools
- Do not restart repeatedly if system shows data corruption warnings

## 7. THIRD-PARTY SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS

### BEFORE allowing any outside technician access:
1. **Get approval** from `[APPROVAL_AUTHORITY]` or designated IT contact
2. **Verify identity** - require company ID and verify with their dispatch
3. **Document everything** - have technician sign in with visitor log
4. **Supervise access** - do not leave technician unattended with systems

### RED FLAGS - Report immediately:
- Technician requests immediate payment for "emergency" repairs
- Cannot provide detailed explanation of findings
- Suggests expensive solutions for simple problems
- Attempts to access systems not related to reported issue
- Requests admin passwords or attempts to disable security features

## 8. ESCALATION PROCEDURES & COMMUNICATION PLAN
